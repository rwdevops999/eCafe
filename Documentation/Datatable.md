# DATA

Tables start with your data.Your column definitions and rows will depend on the shape of your data. Data is an array of objects that will be turned into the rows of your table. Each object in the array represents a row of data. The typescript generic is referred to as TData.

```example
We can define a User (TData) type like this

type User = {
  firstName: string
  lastName: string
  age: number
  visits: number
  progress: number
  status: string
}
```

Whatever you pass to the data table option will become the TData type for the rest of the table instance. Just make sure your column definitions use the same TData type as the data type when you define them later.

## Deep keyed data

If your data is not a nice flat array of objects.

```example
type User = {
  name: {
    first: string
    last: string
  }
  info: {
    age: number
    visits: number
  }
}
```

You will be able to access the data in your column definitions with either dot notation in an accessorKey or simply by using an accessorFn.

```example
const columns = [
  {
    header: 'First Name',
    accessorKey: 'name.first',
  },
  {
    header: 'Last Name',
    accessorKey: 'name.last',
  },
  {
    header: 'Age',
    accessorFn: info => info.age, 
  },
]
```

## Nested sub-row data

```example
type User = {
  firstName: string
  lastName: string
  subRows?: User[] //does not have to be called "subRows", can be called anything
}
```

## Stable reference

The data array that you pass to the table instance MUST have a "stable" reference. In React, you should often use 'React.useState'.

```example
const fallbackData = []

const MyComponent = () => {
    const [data, setData] = useState([]);

    const table = useReactTable({
        columns,
        data ?? fallbackData, //also good to use a fallback array that is defined outside of the component (stable reference)
    });

    return <table>...</table>;
}
```

The main thing to avoid is defining the data array inside the same scope as the useReactTable call.

```example
const MyComponent = () => {
 
  //üòµ BAD: This will cause an infinite loop of re-renders because `columns` is redefined as a new array on every render!
  const columns = [
    // ...
  ];

  //üòµ BAD: This will cause an infinite loop of re-renders because `data` is redefined as a new array on every render!
  const data = [
    // ...
  ];

  //‚ùå Columns and data are defined in the same scope as `useReactTable` without a stable reference, will cause infinite loop!
  const table = useReactTable({
    columns,
    data ?? [], //‚ùå Also bad because the fallback array is re-created on every render
  });

  return <table>...</table>;
}
```

# EXPANDING

Expanding is a feature that allows you to show and hide additional rows of data related to a specific row.

## client-side expanding

To use the client-side expanding features, you need to define the getExpandedRowModel function in your table options. This function is responsible for returning the expanded row model.

```example
const table = useReactTable({
  // other options...
  getExpandedRowModel: getExpandedRowModel(),
})
```

## table rows as exapanded data

If you have a data object like this

```example
type Person = {
  id: number
  name: string
  age: number
  children: Person[]
}
```

Then you can use the getSubRows function to return the children array in each row as expanded rows. The table instance will now understand where to look for the sub rows on each row.

```example
const table = useReactTable({
  // other options...
  getSubRows: (row) => row.children, // return the children array as sub-rows
  getCoreRowModel: getCoreRowModel(),
  getExpandedRowModel: getExpandedRowModel(),
})
```

## expanding UI

```example
<tbody>
  {table.getRowModel().rows.map((row) => (
    <React.Fragment key={row.id}>
     {/* Normal row UI */}
      <tr>
        {row.getVisibleCells().map((cell) => (
          <td key={cell.id}>
            <FlexRender
              render={cell.column.columnDef.cell}
              props={cell.getContext()}
            />
          </td>
        ))}
      </tr>
      {/* If the row is expanded, render the expanded UI as a separate row with a single cell that spans the width of the table */}
      {row.getIsExpanded() && (
        <tr>
          <td colSpan={row.getAllCells().length}> // The number of columns you wish to span for the expanded data if it is not a row that shares the same columns as the parent row
            // Your custom UI goes here
          </td>
        </tr>
      )}
    </React.Fragment>
  ))}
</tbody>
```

## expanded row state

If you need to control the expanded state of the rows in your table, you can do so by using the expanded state and the onExpandedChange option. This allows you to manage the expanded state according to your requirements.

```example
const [expanded, setExpanded] = useState<ExpandedState>({})

const table = useReactTable({
  // other options...
  state: {
    expanded: expanded, // must pass expanded state back to the table
  },
  onExpandedChange: setExpanded
})
```

The ExpandedState type is defined as follows:

```typescript
type ExpandedState = true | Record<string, boolean>
```

If the ExpandedState is true, it means all rows are expanded. If it's a record, only the rows with IDs present as keys in the record and have their value set to true are expanded. For example, if the expanded state is { row1: true, row2: false }, it means the row with ID row1 is expanded and the row with ID row2 is not expanded. This state is used by the table to determine which rows are expanded and should display their subRows, if any.

## UI toggling

You should manually add it within each row's UI to allow users to expand and collapse the row.

```example
const columns = [
  {
    accessorKey: 'name',
    header: 'Name',
  },
  {
    accessorKey: 'age',
    header: 'Age',
  },
  {
    header: 'Children',
    cell: ({ row }) => {
      return row.getCanExpand() ?
        <button
          onClick={row.getToggleExpandedHandler()}
          style={{ cursor: 'pointer' }}
        >
        {row.getIsExpanded() ? 'üëá' : 'üëâ'}
        </button>
       : '';
    },
  },
]
```

## Filtering expanded rows

The filtering process starts from the parent rows and moves downwards. This means if a parent row is excluded by the filter, all its child rows will also be excluded. However, you can change this behavior by using the filterFromLeafRows option. When this option is enabled, the filtering process starts from the leaf (child) rows and moves upwards. This ensures that a parent row will be included in the filtered results as long as at least one of its child or grandchild rows meets the filter criteria.

Additionally, you can control how deep into the child hierarchy the filter process goes by using the maxLeafRowFilterDepth option.

```example
const table = useReactTable({
  // other options...
  getSubRows: row => row.subRows,
  getCoreRowModel: getCoreRowModel(),
  getFilteredRowModel: getFilteredRowModel(),
  getExpandedRowModel: getExpandedRowModel(),
  filterFromLeafRows: true, // search through the expanded rows
  maxLeafRowFilterDepth: 1, // limit the depth of the expanded rows that are searched
})
```

## Paginating expanded rows

Expanded rows are paginated along with the rest of the table (which means expanded rows may span multiple pages). If you want to disable this behavior (which means expanded rows will always render on their parents page. This also means more rows will be rendered than the set page size) you can use the paginateExpandedRows option.

```example
const table = useReactTable({
  // other options...
  paginateExpandedRows: false,
})
```

## Indeterminate checkbox

checkbox with 3 states checked [x]/unchecked [ ]/and somewhat checked [-] (example when one of its childs is checked).
